Hi! I am Siddharth (Sid). I am a Software Engineer at Google Gemini. I recently completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the [University of Rochester](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/) advised by [Aaron White](http://aaronstevenwhite.io/).

My PhD focussed in Natural Language Understanding and Information Extraction. I worked on building computational models of semantics in natural language text. During my PhD, I also worked on building models for extracting semantic information related to events -- event triggers, event chronology, event duration etc.

<!-- I also collaborate with [Ben Van Durme](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~vandurme/) and his group at Johns Hopkins University on projects related to Information Extraction. -->

My papers are listed on the [publications](https://sidsvash26.github.io/publications) page. Full list of publications can be found at [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/Siddharth-Vashishtha/68972934)/[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4Q4zhC0AAAAJ&hl=en)

<!-- In May 2019, I graduated from the University of Rochester with a Masters in [Computational Linguistics](http://www.sas.rochester.edu/lin/graduate/MS.html).During my Masters at Rochester, I worked as a graduate researcher with [Aaron Steven White](http://aaronstevenwhite.io/) at the [FACTS Lab](http://factslab.io/), where I  worked on fine-grained temporal relation extraction. I also worked with [James Allen](http://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/james/) on improving semantic parsing using statistical Word Sense Disambiguation. -->
