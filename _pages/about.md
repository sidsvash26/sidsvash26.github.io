Hi! I am Sid, a Software Engineer at Google Deepmind.

I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the [University of Rochester](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/) advised by [Aaron White](http://aaronstevenwhite.io/).

My Ph.D. focussed on extracting information about events from document collections. During my Ph.D., I also worked on building models for extracting other types of semantic information related to events -- event triggers, event chronology, event duration etc.

My papers are listed on the [publications](https://sidsvash26.github.io/publications) page. Full list of publications can be found at [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/Siddharth-Vashishtha/68972934)/[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4Q4zhC0AAAAJ&hl=en)
